# Installation

## Stable release

To install PyLoadAPI, run this command in your terminal:

``` console
$ pip install pyloadapi
```

To install PyLoadAPI along with the depencies for the commandline interface run this command:

``` console
$ pip install pyloadapi[cli]
```

This is the preferred method to install PyLoadAPI, as it will always
install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have [pip](https://pip.pypa.io) installed, this [Python
installation
guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/)
can guide you through the process.
