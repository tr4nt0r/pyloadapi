"""Types for PyLoadAPI.

This module defines the data structures and command enumerations used by the PyLoadAPI.
The classes included in this module represent various responses from the PyLoad server
and enumerate the commands that can be sent to the server.

Classes
-------
Response
    Base class for all response types, providing methods for converting to and from dictionaries.
StatusServerResponse
    Dataclass for status server response, containing various attributes related to server status.
LoginResponse
    Dataclass for login response, containing user information and session details.
PyLoadCommand
    Enumeration of commands that can be sent to the PyLoad server.

Usage
-----
These classes are used to structure the data received from and sent to the PyLoad server.
They facilitate interaction with the PyLoadAPI by providing clear and structured representations
of the server responses and available commands.
